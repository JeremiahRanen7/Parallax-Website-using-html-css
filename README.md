# Parallax-Website-using-html-css
This is a parallax website that contains a parallax scroll effect created only using HTML and CSS.

The parallax scroll effect is a web design technique where background images move more slowly than the content on the foreground as you scroll down or up a webpage. 

This creates an illusion of depth and adds a visually appealing dynamic to the user experience. In simpler terms, when you scroll, the background image appears to move at a different speed than the rest of the content, providing a sense of depth and immersion on the webpage. It's a popular design trend used to enhance the visual aesthetics and engagement of a website.
